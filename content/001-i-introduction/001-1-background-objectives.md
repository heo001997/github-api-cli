Give it up for mentor Gia Hung and his First Cloud Journey team for a great [Site-to-Site VPN workshop](https://000003.awsstudygroup.com/1-introduce/).


Inheriting that spirit, we will have a similar tour about Site-to-Site VPN but to a lesser extent, where we will have fewer VPCs, Subnets, and EC2 instances.


We will provide an easier point of view for newcomers, focusing only on Site-to-Site VPN with the most reasonable cost possible.


Each piece of information is presented in bite-sized portions, making it easy to keep up with the guide without falling behind.

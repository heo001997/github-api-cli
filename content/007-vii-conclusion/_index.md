Voila! What a journey!


In this workshop, we’ve tackled everything—from architecting an overview to cost estimating, setting up preconditions, configuring, and verifying...


Even though this workshop was relatively straightforward, I believe we had a lot of fun tinkering, scripting, and completing all the tasks.


I’m thrilled to have been here with you today, and I hope you enjoyed the experience as much as I did. ❤️


See you in the next workshop!


BUT DON’T FORGET TO CLEAN UP YOUR STUFF! :)))

Since I’m using the AWS Free Tier for 12 months, this is my cost estimation.


I suggest that this lab should take a maximum of 1.5 hours to set up, test, and run everything.


I’m completely ignoring data costs because the data cost in this lab is VERY, VERY LITTLE (< $0.01).


I’ve optimized the order of enabling services to get the most cost-effective setup, so be very confident in following this workshop line by line.


This is the cost table for my workshop per lab.


| ID | Service                      | Pricing | Unit | Average Usage Time (hour) | Actual cost                 |
| -- | ---------------------------- | ------- | ---- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1  | VPC                          | Free    | X    | X                         | $0.00                       |
| 2  | Subnet                       | Free    | X    | X                         | $0.00                       |
| 3  | Route Table                  | Free    | X    | X                         | $0.00                       |
| 4  | Security Group               | Free    | X    | X                         | $0.00                       |
| 5  | Internet Gateway             | Free    | X    | X                         | $0.00                       |
| 6  | Virtual Private Gateway      | Free    | X    | X                         | $0.00                       |
| 7  | Customer Gateway             | Free    | X    | X                         | $0.00                       |
| 8  | Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)  | $0.0116 | 2    | 1.25 hour                 | $0.00 
(Free Tier Included) |
| 9  | Site-to-Site VPN Connections | $0.05   | 1    | 30                        | $0.025                      |


So, the final cost should be a maximum of **$0.025** for your total 1.5-hour usage time.
